                                Compared to traditional broker firms, trading on eToro costs considerably lower trading fees. eToro charges clients commissions, spreads, and financial rates for various types of transactions. Here are more details on the trading fees:

                            <p class="regular-text">
                                All eToro traders, except US-based users, must convert their currency into the platform's available base currency, USD.
                            </p>
                            <p class="regular-text">   
                                If you are based in a non-US nation and wish to deposit or withdraw funds from an account, you will need to exchange your USD. The conversion charge for major currencies like GBP, EUR, CHF, or AUD is 50–150 pip or approximately 0.4% of the total sum, depending on the current exchange rate.
                            </p>
                            <p class="regular-text">    
                                If you decide to deposit or withdraw funds through debit/credit cards or PayPal, the conversion fee begins from 150 pips.

                                eToro, as a market maker, sets its own spreads, which are average compared to other market makers. For example, the spread on the most liquid currency pair, EUR/USD, at eToro is quoted at 1.0 pips.
                            </p>

                                However, spreads on other assets, such as equity and index CFDs, commodities, and cryptocurrencies, tend to be higher compared to other brokers.

                            <p class="regular-text">
                                Compared to other brokers, eToro has high and less affordable spreads, generally making it difficult for beginners to profit. For example, the spread on AMD is $0.15, while competitors offer the same CFD for $0.03. In addition, gold on the platform has a spread as high as 45.0 pips compared to 1.0 pips offered by other brokers, and the spread on the S&P 500 is 75.0 pips versus 0.60 pips.
