                                For more context, consider the following scenario. If you deposit $2,000 into your broker account and engage in a CFD trade using 5:1 leverage, your position is worth $10,000. However, if the position's value drops by 25%, your loss would be $2,500, which is 25% of $10,000.

                                This means that your current balance of $2,000 would not cover the losses, resulting in a debt owed to the broker of $500. However, if the same trade is conducted on FXpro, which offers negative balance protection, the losses will be, at most, the initial deposit of $2,000. Therefore, instead of having a negative balance of $500, the account balance will be $0.
