                                Naga is safe, with valid reasons. Since its inception in 2015, this broker firm has taken vital steps to ensure it is fully regulated and licensed by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission. Also, it is a publicly listed company in Cyprus and has an operating technology company in Germany.
